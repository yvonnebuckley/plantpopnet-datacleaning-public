#Input and dependencies
#This script takes in a dataset of the shape of the PPN dataset (data), respecting its headers order and spelling. 
#It makes use of the plant_unique_id computed during the data cleaning steps, and generally assumes the data to be clean of errors. 

#The script produces the output dataset dat2, in which each line is one genet in one year. 
#As individual rosettes are not marked in the PPN protocol, this script pools all rosettes attributed to the same individual each year, and pools them together to compute the size of the individual (genet). 
#The same logic as on the field is respected; the leaves are added up, only the width and length of the longest accross all rosettes is recorded. If the widht of the longest leaf is missing, the biggest width is recorded. If a number of leaves in y0 is missing, the number of leaves of the genet is set to 0. In y1, the code checks and only adds up the number of leaves of the rosettes that survived. Nummber of leaves is set to NA if a rosette that is marked as survival= yes has no number of leaves recorded. 
#Similarly, the longest stem accross all rosettes is recorded, and the inflorescnece data corresponding to this stem is recorded. When inflorescence data for the longest stem is missing, the longest inflorescene for which data is knwon is selected.
