# Plantpopnet-Data-Cleaning
Repository for code used in cleaning Plantpopnet data files. Yvonne Buckley 12/11/18

This Repository is currently being used to store snippets of code and data to run them on. It is hosted by Yvonne Buckley but includes contributions from Ruth Kelly, Maude Baudraz, Alain Finn, Caroline McKeon and Annabel Smith.

Eventually we hope to have an R-markdown file which details a series of data cleaning steps that can be run on the compiled data object that includes all Plantpopnet data collected to date (Nov 2018). Once we have completed this project we will be able to run the data cleaning process on any new single year, single site data set contributed.

GENERAL RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (AF to add these 12/11/18)

1. Initial every document you create e.g. AF_cleaning_script.Rmd
2. Anyone can create/edit code snippets, but Alain will compile them into the master Rmd file
3. Only create branches with permission from the file owner. 
4. Delete any unwanted files as soon as possible. 
5. Revert to this document prior to starting a new task. Label the task as yours and then mark as complete once done.
6. All finalised code chunks to be moved to the "Master" folder so they can be directly sourced into the compiler without a file path
7. Please run the "global fixes" part of the master compiler script and any other relevant fixes before working on your own code chunk
8. Work on issues using the Projects and Issues sections of the github project, you can append commit messages to the relevant issue using "#issuenumber" e.g. "#7" and you can also tag the relevant person
